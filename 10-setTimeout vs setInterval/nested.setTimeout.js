// Nested setTimeout
// There are two ways of running something regularly.

// One is setInterval. The other one is a nested setTimeout, like this:

let timerId = setTimeout(function tick() {
  console.log("tick");
  timerId = setTimeout(tick, 2000); // (*)
}, 2000);

// The nested setTimeout is a more flexible method than setInterval. This way the next call may be scheduled differently, depending on the results of the current one.

// For instance, we need to write a service that sends a request to the server every 5 seconds asking for data,
// but in case the server is overloaded, it should increase the interval to 10, 20, 40 seconds…

// Here’s the pseudocode:

/* let delay = 5000;

let timerId = setTimeout(function request() {
  ...send request...

  if (request failed due to server overload) {
    // increase the interval to the next run
    delay *= 2;
  }

  timerId = setTimeout(request, delay);

}, delay); */
